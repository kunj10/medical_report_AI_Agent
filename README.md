# 🧠 Multi-Agent Medical Diagnosis System using Google ADK

This project leverages **Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)** to simulate a virtual multidisciplinary team of AI medical specialists. Each AI agent is specialized in a different medical domain (Cardiology, Psychology, Pulmonology) and collaborates to produce a comprehensive diagnosis based on a real-world medical case.

## ✨ Features

- 🩺 **Specialist AI Agents**:
  - **Cardiologist**: Evaluates heart-related symptoms.
  - **Psychologist**: Assesses mental and emotional health.
  - **Pulmonologist**: Analyzes respiratory concerns.

- 👥 **Multidisciplinary Team Agent**:
  - Synthesizes findings from all specialists.
  - Delivers a consolidated medical summary and suggested next steps.

- 📄 **Input**:
  - Realistic medical report (`.txt`) with patient symptoms, history, test results, and lifestyle factors.

- 📤 **Output**:
  - Final AI-generated diagnosis saved to `results/final_diagnosis.txt`.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```bash
.
├── main_adk.py                          # Orchestrates multi-agent workflow
├── adk_agents.py                        # Contains medical agent factory definitions
├── Medical Reports/
│   └── Medical Rerort - Michael Johnson - Panic Attack Disorder.txt
├── results/
│   └── final_diagnosis.txt             # Auto-generated by the program
├── apikey.env                          # Stores your Gemini API key
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Reads the medical report.
2. Creates specialist agents using `MedicalAgentFactory`.
3. Each specialist AI independently analyzes the report.
4. If all specialist outputs are valid, a **Multidisciplinary Agent** is invoked.
5. The final collaborative diagnosis is saved and printed.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-adk-agents.git
   cd medical-adk-agents
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your API key**
   - Create a file named `.env` or `apikey.env`:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
     ```

## 🧪 Run the Project

```bash
python main_adk.py
```

Upon successful execution, you will see outputs like:
```
Cardiologist is running...
Psychologist is running...
Pulmonologist is running...
MultidisciplinaryTeam is running...
Final diagnosis has been saved to results/final_diagnosis.txt
```

## 📝 Sample Use Case

> 📁 `Medical Reports/Medical Rerort - Michael Johnson - Panic Attack Disorder.txt`  
A 29-year-old male with recurring chest pain, dizziness, and anxiety. Diagnostic reports show no cardiac issues, suggesting a possible psychosomatic condition.

The system evaluates it from three perspectives and generates an integrative report to guide treatment directions.

## ⚙️ Dependencies

- `google-adk`
- `python-dotenv`
- `litellm`

> All listed in `requirements.txt`
